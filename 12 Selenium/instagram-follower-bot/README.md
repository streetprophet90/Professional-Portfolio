# Instagram Follower Bot

This Python script uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into Instagram, navigating to a specified account, and following its followers. It's designed to interact with Instagram's web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) (ensure it's in your system PATH)

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-follower-bot.git
    cd instagram-follower-bot
    ```

2. Install the required packages.

    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```
3. Open the `instagram_follower_bot.py` file in a text editor.

4. Replace the placeholder values with your actual ChromeDriver path, Instagram username, and password.

    ```python
    CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = "YOUR CHROME DRIVER PATH"
    SIMILAR_ACCOUNT = "buzzfeedtasty"
    USERNAME = "YOUR INSTAGRAM USERNAME"
    PASSWORD = "YOUR INSTAGRAM PASSWORD"
    ```



**Note:** Be responsible when automating interactions with websites. Make sure your actions comply with Instagram's policies and terms of service. Use the script at your own risk.
