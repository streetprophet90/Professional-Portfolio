# Instagram Follower Bot

This Python script uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into Instagram, navigating to a specified account, and following its followers. It's designed to interact with Instagram's web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) (ensure it's in your system PATH)

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-follower-bot.git
    cd instagram-follower-bot
    ```

2. Install the required packages.

    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```
3. Open the `instagram_follower_bot.py` file in a text editor.

4. Replace the placeholder values with your actual ChromeDriver path, Instagram username, and password.

    ```python
    CHROME_DRIVER_PATH = "YOUR CHROME DRIVER PATH"
    SIMILAR_ACCOUNT = "buzzfeedtasty"
    USERNAME = "YOUR INSTAGRAM USERNAME"
    PASSWORD = "YOUR INSTAGRAM PASSWORD"
    ```

5. Customize the `login`, `find_followers`, and `follow` methods based on your Instagram web interface. Update the login logic and actions to find and interact with the necessary elements.

    ```python
    def login(self):
        # Implement login logic here
        # Example: Find username and password fields, input credentials, and click login button

    def find_followers(self):
        # Navigate to the page where the followers are listed
        # Locate the desired elements based on the HTML structure

    def follow(self):
        # Iterate through the followers and click the follow button
        # Handle any exceptions that may occur during the process
    ```

6. Save the changes.

7. Run the script.

    ```bash
    python instagram_follower_bot.py
    ```


**Note:** Be responsible when automating interactions with websites. Make sure your actions comply with Instagram's policies and terms of service. Use the script at your own risk.
