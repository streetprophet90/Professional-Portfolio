## The key lines of the Morse code converter Python script 

1. `MORSE_CODE_DICT`: This is a dictionary that maps each character to its Morse code representation. It includes uppercase letters, numbers, and some common punctuation marks.

2. `text_to_morse` function: This function takes a string as input and iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if it's in the `MORSE_CODE_DICT`. If yes, it appends the Morse code equivalent to the `morse_code` string. If the character is not in the dictionary (e.g., for spaces), it appends a space to separate Morse code characters.

3. `if __name__ == "__main__":` : This is a common Python construct. It ensures that the code block beneath it is only executed if the script is run directly, not if it's imported as a module in another script.

4. `user_input = input("Enter a string: ")`: This line prompts the user to input a string in the command line.

5. `morse_result = text_to_morse(user_input)`: It calls the `text_to_morse` function with the user's input and stores the result in the `morse_result` variable.

6. `print(f"Morse Code: {morse_result}")`: This line prints the Morse code equivalent of the entered string.

The script utilizes a dictionary to quickly look up the Morse code for each character, making the conversion process straightforward. The resulting Morse code is then displayed in the command line.
