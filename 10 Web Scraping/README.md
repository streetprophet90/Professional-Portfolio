This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and it's essential to be aware of ethical considerations and legal implications. Ensure that you have permission to scrape the website and comply with the website's terms of service.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required Python libraries before running the scripts:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup.
- `selenium`: For automating web browsers.

## ChromeDriver Setup

If you're using Selenium with Chrome, download ChromeDriver:

- [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)

Ensure that you download the version compatible with your Chrome browser.

## Usage

### Basic Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:

1. Edit the `url` variable in the script to the target website.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python beautifulsoup_scraper.py
   ```

### Web Scraping with Selenium:

1. Set up ChromeDriver and specify its path in the script.
2. Edit the `url` variable in the script to the target website.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python selenium_scraper.py
   ```

Adjust the code in the scripts according to the structure of the website you're scraping. Be respectful of the website's resources and policies.
