### `main.py`

```markdown
# Pong Game - main.py

This is the main script for a simple Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Execute the `main.py` file to start the game.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Dependencies

- Python
- Turtle graphics library

## Controls

- Player on the right:
  - Move up: Up arrow key
  - Move down: Down arrow key

- Player on the left:
  - Move up: W key
  - Move down: S key

## Gameplay

- The game starts with two paddles and a ball.
- Players control the paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
- If the ball passes a paddle, the opponent scores a point.
- The game continues until manually closed.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the classic Pong game.


### `paddle.py`

```markdown
# Pong Game - paddle.py

This module defines the `Paddle` class used in the Pong game.

## Paddle Class

### Methods

- `__init__(self, position)`: Initializes a paddle object at the specified position.
- `go_up(self)`: Moves the paddle upward.
- `go_down(self)`: Moves the paddle downward.

### Attributes

- `shape`: Square
- `color`: White
- `Size`: Stretch width = 5, stretch length = 1

## Usage

Create instances of the `Paddle` class in the main script (`main.py`) to represent the left and right paddles.

```

### `ball.py`

```markdown
# Pong Game - ball.py

This module defines the `Ball` class used in the Pong game.

## Ball Class

### Methods

- `__init__(self)`: Initializes a ball object with initial attributes.
- `move(self)`: Moves the ball.
- `bounce_y(self)`: Bounces the ball vertically.
- `bounce_x(self)`: Bounces the ball horizontally.
- `reset_position(self)`: Resets the ball's position and speed.

### Attributes

- `color`: White
- `shape`: Circle
- `Initial Speed`: x_move = 3, y_move = 3
- `Initial Move Speed`: 0.1

## Usage

Create an instance of the `Ball` class in the main script (`main.py`) to represent the game ball.

```
### `scoreboard.py`

```markdown
# Pong Game - scoreboard.py

This module defines the `Scoreboard` class used in the Pong game.

## Scoreboard Class

### Methods

- `__init__(self)`: Initializes a scoreboard object with initial attributes.
- `update_scoreboard(self)`: Clears and updates the scoreboard display.
- `l_point(self)`: Increments the left player's score.
