# Birthday Email Sender

This is an extra hard starting project that automates sending birthday emails to people whose birthdays are listed in a CSV file (`birthdays.csv`). The program checks if today matches a birthday in the CSV file, picks a random letter template, replaces placeholders with the birthday person's name, and sends the letter to their email address.

## Project Steps

1. **Update the birthdays.csv:**
   - The CSV file should contain the names, birthdays (month and day), and email addresses of the individuals.
